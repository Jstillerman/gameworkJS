gameworkJS
==========
GameWorks is a framework to help you build games! I'm not claiming that this is the best way to make games, in fact I know it's not, this is just how I think games should be layed out (Scenes, Objdects, Sprites ect..) along with some additional tool to help you get rolling quick (Mouse, keyboard, and tilemap support)

My goal is to create a modular framework that helps you make games. The idea is that you use the main library and then you also use a different file for all of the different things you want to have in your game. The files for your project will be as followed.  <br>
1. index.html - the webpage <br>
2. game.js - the actual game that you write <br>
3. gamework.js - the main backbone to your game <br>
4. gamework_ ... - these are the extra moduals that you will use ex:gamework_mouse.js <br>
